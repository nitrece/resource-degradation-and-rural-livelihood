Resource degradation is the deterioration of the environment through
depletion of resources such as air, water and soil, the destruction of
ecosystems and the extinction of wildlife.

We use up various resources everyday, but dont think that they are not being
properly used. Trees are being cut down at an astonishing rate 200,000 per
day, globally. And who bothers to plant them back. Petroluem is being sucked
up at tremendous rates all over the world, and much of it has been used up
already. Most of the coal has already been mined out with only a few still
left out.

It takes millions of years to form coal and petroleum. Once finish it all
up then it won't be possible to get it back any more until a million years
later. There may be several better ways of using coal and petroleum, than
using it as a fuel. Petroleum chemicals often form the base for production
of any organic chemical. All petroleum chemicals have a carbon skeleton
which is used by organic chemists and organic product industries to produce
different organic chemicals.

All over the world rural people are the ones who are most ignored. Much of
the resources that are used by the industries are extracted from places where
the rural people live. However, we slash down the trees, bomb down the
mountains, turn forests into ghost-towns to dig out metals, use up all the
water, pollute it, and sweep out the animals. This leaves the rural people
with nothing other than the same nothing. They are not valued at all even
though they have been living there for generations.

Left out with no other means of living, the rural people are forced to move
out to the cities, for working in the industies and living in very unhealthy
conditions in the slums which circle around the city. This way the industries
have a constant supply of workers, which is an added benefit. Rural people
have to now be exposed to various toxins.
